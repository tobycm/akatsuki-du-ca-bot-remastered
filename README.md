# What is this?
### History
One day, Toby saw his friend (stranger 👨 at that moment) with his Discord bot 🤖 being advertise on Facebook 😱. Toby thought it is so cool 🤯 to make a Discord bot 🤖 so he DMed 📧 the owner of that bot ([@KenjiKobayashi126](https://github.com/KenjiKobayashi126)) and asked for permission 👍 to code 💻 the Discord bot with him. Luckily 🍀 and sadly 😭, he accepted ✅. The sad 😭 part is that I only know 🧠 Python 🐍 at that moment 🕒 and no Javascript 💀. Toby decided to create 🔧 his own Discord bot 🤖 and named it "Akatsuki Du Ca". (LETS GO BIG TOBY W 😎)
